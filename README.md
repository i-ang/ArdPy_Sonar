# ArdPy_Sonar
In this Project, I intend on building a simple Sonar System utilizing an Arduino.
Once the sonar is complete, I will build a simple display showing the sweep and objects by using Python and Tkinter. 


Ver 1.0--> Using LEDs as visual indicators, the Sonar now detects objects and the controller displays it by lighting LEDs.

Next steps: configure the servo/stepper motor to swivle the Sonar.
